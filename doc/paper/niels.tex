\section{Introduction}

Experimenting with composition and contraction.

\section{Design}

Primitive types: int[32,64], float[32,64], complex[64,128], bool, and string.
Arrays are first-class cizitens. Should everything be an array by default? Similar to the notion of Matlab?

Array-notation for promoting operators to operations on arrays.
Serial semantics.
No short-hand notations for anything.
Main is a block of statements:
main {
    a = ones as (3,3,3)
    a = 1 as (3,3,3)
    a = zeros as (3,3,3)
    a = 0 (3,3,3)
    a = 1.0 as (3,3,3)
    b = a+1
}

'as' is a shape operator. Taking an array and a shape as argument.
ones as (3,3,3)

Shapes are declared with parenthesis (3,3,3)
Indexing is declared with square brackets []
Ranges are declared with ellipsis 1..1
Slicing is indexing and ranges such as ones[]

Blocks can be nested.

Built-in declarative command-line parsing. Inspirated by Chapel and docopt.

Mathematical ASCII notation, that is, not the extent of APL og unicode.
Inspiration from ISO 80000-2 for set/range/interval notation.
Ranges should something like [1..10] or [1;10].

Faciliate a rich read-evaluation-print-loop (REPL) environment.
Inspiration from IPython and facilitate the use of Jupyter.
Convenient command-line interface.
Inspiration from Chapel and param variables extended the concept with support for docopt.
 - That is, module is documented and from documentation cli-parameters are extracted.

\subsection{Grammar}

\textbf{Loops}

A single loop-contruct exists, that of a well-known while-loop. The motivations behind this choice, specifically to exclude for-loops, is that loop-constructs are intended as drivers for time-steps in simulations or simulations until some stopping criteria is met. While-loops serve such repetive patterns well. For-loops on the other hand are great for iteration over an index-set, such as the index from 0-100, and their neighbors i+1, i-1 and such.
However, it is the intent of niels to capture such loop constructs by expressing them as array operations on array-subsets instead of a loop construct.

\textbf{Conditionals}

Conditionals traditional exist in multiple forms for control-flow constructs such as if-then-else and switch/case statements. In Niels this is expressed with the same construct, the when-is-otherwise.

\textbf{Organization}

Collections, modules, and namespaces.

\section{Tools of the trade}

Phases:

Text-scanner / lexer
parser
typechecker
scope tables
resolution
calling
ffi

The dragon book
Ambigious grammar?
Context free or context sensitive grammar?
Parser generator or parser combinator?

Parser algorithms LL, LALR(1), LR(1), GLR, lookahead and backtracking.
Capabilities of the tool should match the requirements of the design.

Choice of compiler-compiler, something that will generate C or C++.
First off able to construct interpreters easily, secondly compilers.
Something worth considering are requirements of the artifact produced by tools.
Does it require another interpreter? Virtual machine? Runtime libraries?
Antlr\cite{cc:antlr} seems popular, however, version 4.5 does not support C/C++ as codegen target and various googling/stackoverflow revealed that support was buggy in previous version.
So I concluded that the niceities of antlr 4 would not be available, in conclusion not much motivation for using it.
Lex\cite{cc:lex}/Yacc\cite{cc:yacc} is a classic, however, unconveniently licences.
Flex/Bison since it seems like it gets the job done, decent license, documented, and a wealth of community knowledge.

Lemon\cite{cc:lemon} and parsec\cite{cc:parsec} might be interesting too.
There is most likely better tools out there, something newer but to start out experimenting flex/bison should be fine.
BNFC, the backus-naur-form converter, emits

One could of course also choose and implement it by hand, but I just want something well documented and supported.
Considering existing popular languages, what are their approaches? Interpreted languages Python, Ruby, and PHP. Not in the same category but a HPC language with a modern feel. Chapel, what is the implementation approach?

\section{Implementation}

Interpreted in the sense that native code generation is hidden from the user.

Flex/Bison.

Type promotion
 * Implicit for scalar operations (cast to widest type)
 * Explicit for array operations (convey cost to the user)
   - Explicit type conversion for array-expressions
     e.g. i32[] + float[] => error, require: float[](i32[]) + float[]
 * Pseudo-broadcast array OP scalar operations
 * Broadcast array OP operations
     
OO terms:

 * Normalized Heterogenous AST, ref ANTRL (Terence P.)
 * External visitor (evaluation / execution)
 * Embedded visitor (pretty printing)

\section{Performance Study}

Vestibulum vitae consequat sapien. Aliquam malesuada sit amet ipsum ut hendrerit. Nullam sit amet tristique eros. Integer lacus leo, viverra vel velit eu, dapibus aliquam mi. Maecenas commodo non quam a porttitor. Nullam vel sollicitudin tellus. Etiam nec diam nibh. Aenean aliquam arcu non leo lobortis, et tincidunt dolor viverra. Morbi tincidunt magna eu mollis molestie. Duis eu egestas quam.

\section{Future Work}

Curabitur consectetur vel magna in dictum. Aliquam fermentum tortor sed mi sagittis lobortis. Donec eleifend dui sit amet libero pretium posuere. Nam cursus ligula sit amet libero ornare, ac pulvinar diam laoreet. Etiam consectetur magna eu turpis posuere, a mollis arcu consectetur. Aliquam a diam vel metus fringilla tincidunt. Sed euismod vitae mauris sit amet pharetra. Aliquam euismod vehicula orci. Sed volutpat aliquet turpis ut viverra. Curabitur ac rutrum ex. Nunc dapibus ligula tempus mattis vestibulum. Praesent id sapien condimentum, mattis neque a, consectetur nunc. In elementum sed nunc vel feugiat. Sed cursus dictum ante, at tincidunt nibh mollis ac. Cras ultrices nisi dolor, sed ultrices ex dignissim ac.

\section{Conclusion}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum molestie tortor non interdum tempus. Nullam rutrum metus ac varius varius. Integer sit amet ipsum ipsum. Integer vehicula, eros ac laoreet posuere, felis tortor hendrerit nunc, et tincidunt massa tortor ut odio. Curabitur nisi libero, ornare at quam a, vulputate tincidunt lacus. Nulla sodales enim a sapien elementum porttitor. Aenean feugiat gravida libero eu rutrum. Nunc mattis dui eu justo bibendum, nec maximus ligula auctor. Ut orci velit, varius eu lobortis in, scelerisque eget diam. In sapien nunc, rutrum at tincidunt vel, dignissim at tellus. Duis imperdiet sapien dui, eu dignissim ipsum tristique vel. Nunc convallis mattis enim ac pellentesque. Sed ut fermentum libero, at feugiat massa. Cras a mattis nisi. Nullam ultrices enim id luctus interdum.
